# homeassistant-fe-tesla

This Home Assistant configuration allows you to control the functionality of your Telsa with a GUI that is similar to the mobile phone application.

This is an early release, time is short so I will work on adding features and funtions when and as I can.  People are welcome to fork the code and tweak it too.

If you use this and like it then please [![Buy Me a Coffee](/images/bmsc.png "Buy Me a Coffee")*Buy Me a Coffee*][https://www.buymeacoffee.com/daveshaw301]

### Things to know
At present I only have the screen shots for a Red Model 3.  I don't have any access to other Teslas so the user will need to screenshot and format the images as needed.  The images are stored under models/(3/y/x/s)/(colour) - feel free to copy the red model 3 folder and add new images in the appropriate place.

### To do list
1) Climate screen - Heated seat controls - there was an issue with state images that was proving a little tricky 
2) Climate screen - changing the off button to on and illuminating when pressed
3) Climate screen - adding higher and lower icons to adjust temperature
4) Climate screen - Highlighting Vent icon when pressed and windows opened
5) Controls screen - Vented Window icon needs to light up when pressed and windows open
6) Controls screen - Adding padlock unlock button
7) Controls screen - Adding Frunk and Trunk open labels
8) Controls screen - Adding charging flap icon and changing the background state when opened
9) Controls screen - Adding PSI to toggle
10) Controls screen - Higher and Lower buttons to set the charge ampage.
